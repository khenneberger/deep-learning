HW1 Prompt: Given training data: house_train.csv, test data features: house_test.csv.
File House_feature_description.csv describes the meaning of each column in the data set.
Program a linear regression (LR) model to predict the labels in the test data (you decide which features you would like to use in the LR model).

HW2 Prompt: Use the training data from noshow_train.csv to predict the no-show status of the patients from noshow_test.csv.

HW3 Prompt: Use the training data from fashion_mnist_train.csv to predict the labels of the test data from fashion_mnist_test.csv

HW4 Prompt: Use the training data from train.csv to predict the labels of the test data from test.csv.

HW5 Prompt: Use the training data from twitter_train.csv to predict the sentiment labels of the test data from twitter_test.csv.
