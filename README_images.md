This dataset is a database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray or CT images. It contains COVID-19 cases as well as MERS, SARS, and ARDS

## Background 

In the context of a COVID-19 pandemic, we want to improve prognostic predictions to triage and manage patient care. Data is the first step to developing any diagnostic/prognostic tool. While there exist large public datasets of more typical chest X-rays from the NIH [Wang 2017], Spain [Bustos 2019], Stanford [Irvin 2019], MIT [Johnson 2019] and Indiana University [Demner-Fushman 2016], there is no collection of COVID-19 chest X-rays or CT scans designed to be used for computational analysis.

The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) presents several unique features [Fang, 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200432) and [Ai 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200642). While the diagnosis is confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), infected patients with pneumonia may present on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images with a pattern that is only moderately characteristic for the human eye [Ng, 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryct.2020200034). In late January, a Chinese team published a paper detailing the clinical and paraclinical features of COVID-19. They reported that patients present abnormalities in chest CT images with most having bilateral involvement [Huang 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext). Bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation constitute the typical findings in chest CT images of intensive care unit (ICU) patients on admission [Huang 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext). In comparison, non-ICU patients show bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation in their chest CT images [Huang 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext). In these patients, later chest CT images display bilateral ground-glass opacity with resolved consolidation [Huang 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext).

## Expected outcomes

Tool impact: This would give physicians an edge and allow them to act with more confidence while they wait for the analysis of a radiologist by having a digital second opinion confirm their assessment of a patient's condition. Also, these tools can provide quantitative scores to consider and use in studies.

Data impact: Image data linked with clinically relevant attributes in a public dataset that is designed for ML will enable parallel development of these tools and rapid local validation of models. Furthermore, this data can be used for completely different tasks.
